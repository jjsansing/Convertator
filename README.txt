To install Convertator, in your home directory, create a directory named
Convertator.  Enter that directory and copy the following files:

  Convertator.jar
  preferences
  base_data.cvu
  site.cvu
(Note: The Ritasa site is no longer active, but the files are here to
avoid errors.)

Then copy the directories data and interface with their contents.



To run the program, cd to the Convertator directory and run 

  java -jar Convertator.jar

The help files should be sufficient to learn how to use the basics.



The source code for the application is in the src directory.  The javadoc is in
src/doc.  Open the src/doc/index.html file in a browser.



To test the program, run it and in the equation field, enter the keyword "file"
in the first column, followed by the name of a file which has test data.
Examples of test data files are in the testing directory.
